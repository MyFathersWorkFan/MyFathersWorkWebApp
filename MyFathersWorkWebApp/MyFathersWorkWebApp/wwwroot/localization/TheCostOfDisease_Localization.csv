Immortality_Title;<b>A Foreword</b>;;
Immortality_Content;Herein contains a historical account of a peculiar lineage. One that spans multiple generations and by all accounts will continue to fascinate historians for many years to come.<br /><br />I have endeavored to provide as complete a scholarly history as one could provide given the conflicting accounts and whims of hearsay. While many of the details, haunting to the imagination as they may be, stretch the very limits of our human understanding, it is my hope that this text and the accompanying research materials procured will provide evidence as to their truth. The harrowing and potentially supernatural series of events has the capacity to shake the very foundations of the scientific world as we perceive it.<br /><br />With deference to the fellowship that commissioned this explicit work, though I have never met with these generous benefactors, I humbly submit this biographical account in its entirety and swear by the veracity of the contents within.<br /><br />In good health,<br />Dr. Ensign Benwallis;;
ScenarioStart_Title;<b>GENERATION I:</b>;;
ScenarioStart_SubTitle;<b>Yellow Fever</b>;;
ScenarioStart_Content;The siblings' arrival to claim their considerable inheritance was met with the indifference of a murky countryside, gray and overcast. The sky was heavy with moisture, but could not crack into a tempest, as if heralding the unfortunate circumstances to which they would soon find themselves.<br /><br />Upon reaching the village, a foul stench tinged the air as teams of horses pulled the charcoal wagons like a silent funeral procession through the muddy streets. Emaciated peasants shielded their faces from the ashen gloom, seemingly unbothered by the display, and went about their somber activities uninterrupted. Several canvas-bound carts lined the edges of the main road, the dismal, gray skin of a human foot sometimes dangling freely from a rip in the fabric.<br /><br />The Yellow Fever had struck the village, and for several weeks any visit to its somber limits forced the young heirs to keep a cloth handkerchief about their mouth and nostrils to protect from the miasma. While they were remiss to admit it, this seemed the perfect macabre backdrop in which to advance their father's dreadful business.<br /><br />While the prevailing mood in the village was one of morose caution, the young entrepreneurs saw potential in these darkened streets. A particularly ambitious individual could lift this gray village into a thriving city. Perhaps even an aristocrat with coin to spare could make a persuasive argument as to its direction.<br /><br />As the kindred surveyed the dreary countryside from behind the iron gates of their estate, they watched the billowing mists move slowly across the valley. The townsfolk stirred as a disquieting laugh echoed down from the hillside. They were excited to begin their father's work in earnest!;;
Dubious_Title;<b>Dubious Bartering</b>;;
Dubious_Content;Within days of their settling in to their spouse's liking, the local diocese sent a messenger to speak with each of the heirs about their father's charitability towards the diseased — or lack thereof. The bishop entreated them to donate precious time and money to help aid the sick at the church.<br /><br />Having an extensive background in biological studies at the university, the youths proudly offered their scientific services in subduing the epidemic. The bishop was unenthusiastic about the response and pressed them to change their mind — to no avail.;;

Fever1_End_Title;Second round Event - Election Season;;
Fever1_End_Content;Political pandering may require more than simply a silver tongue and a bright smile. Be sure to have some extra capital on hand as the need may arise.;;
Gen1CreepyTrack_Title;Enemy of the People;;
Gen1CreepyTrack_Content0;The increasingly eccentric actions of the siblings aroused dark memories from the previous generation, and tense rumors once again circulated throughout the village. However, as these same fears were shared more openly, the news attracted opportunities for those with similar, nefarious intent.;;
Gen1CreepyTrackRes_Title;A Seedy Arrangement;;
Gen1CreepyTrackRes_1_Content;It was unorthodox for {0}, or anyone of that reclusive lineage, to entertain unknown visitors, but something must have piqued their curiosity. A conversation from an evening dinner is noted in a journal entry:<br /><br />"Your estate is simply exquisite," the representative was noted as saying with an unsettling grin. "I am impressed to find a rarefied jewel nestled in such a remote place. But, as you will no doubt agree, it can always use improvement and I would like to offer you support in this." In fact, it was noted that the individual's mannerisms were especially secretive and plotting.<br /><br />The representative from the Fraternity of Hunters offered their support with substantial funds. With the hope" that this kindness would be repaid in the future.;;
Gen1CreepyTrackRes_2_Content;It was unorthodox for {0}, or anyone of that reclusive lineage, to entertain unknown visitors, but something must have piqued their curiosity. A conversation from an evening dinner is noted in a journal entry:<br /><br />"Your reputation is known across the region for vehemently challenging the established norms," the representative from the Order of St. Hubertus was noted as saying with a wide grin. They leaned in conspiratorially, an expensive perfume loud enough in fragrance to draw water from the eyes. "From what I hear, you are unwilling to allow the rules of academia to hold your work back from its true excellence. Please, let me admire your experimentation."<br /><br />This was highly controversial! And to be so brazen about it! It was left to the scientist to decide if being granted the opportunity to <b>perform an extra experiment</b> was worth the possible consequences of revealing one's work.;;
Gen1CreepyYes_A_Content;The individual produced a banker's cheque from their overcoat and an ink pen from their breast pocket, signing the note with an extravagant signature. Stamped upon the egg-shell cardstock in golden foil was the insignia of a bow and arrow. The man twirled his handlebar mustache with a deep laugh before exiting by carriage.<br /><br />Perhaps it had been a chance meeting, yet for some reason, the scientist suspected a deeper meaning had yet to be revealed.;;
Gen1CreepyYes_B_Content;The representative was appreciative of {0}'s humble demonstration. As the experiment was performed, they proceeded to take extensive notes which were then sealed up in a leather satchel as they departed soon after. The satchel was conspicuously emblazoned with the insignia of a wolf's head.<br /><br />Perhaps it had been a chance meeting, yet for some reason, the scientist suspected a deeper meaning had yet to be revealed.;;
Gen1CreepyNo_Title;Ridiculous!;;
Gen1CreepyNo_Content;As one might expect, the next few pages of notes in the journal are filled with unflattering jests and laughter at this absolutely half-witted rube and the seedy proposition they had offered. And so {0} waved them away with flippant disregard for wasting their time.<br /><br />An individual has no allegiance but to one's self. They would not be saddled with some unknown, absurd consequence!<br /><br />However, unbeknownst to the semi-virtuous scientist, there was another party that observed this gesture with great interest. Perhaps in time this mystery would be revealed.;;
Gen1SanityTrack_Title;To Quell the Mind;;
Gen1SanityTrack_Content0;Just as a sharpened blade loses some of its steel, so it is the same with a pointed intellect so repeatedly ground. This precise focus upon scientific labors caused the siblings' brains to wander and ache for relief even as a powerful ambition compelled them well beyond their physical tolerances.;;
Gen1SanityTrackRes_Title;A Letter From an Old Friend;;
Gen1SanityTrackRes_0_Content;"You shouldn't drive yourself so hard," the letter stated. "It is unsustainable. For each night you toil away until dawn's light, it takes years from your mind."<br /><br />While the nature of their work ensured that it was performed in solitude, {0}, and their spouse especially, still enjoyed writing letters to the few friends who would receive them. This particular letter from an old colleague at university recommended a specific retreat in Rovinj, where the warm Mediterranean air would rejuvenate the body and quiet the mind. For a small price, they could own a vacation home.<br /><br />While this time away could have a negative affect on their child, it would also allow them to <b>gain knowledge</b> and <b>calm their sanity</b>. Refusal, however, would carry no risk and maybe give them more time to complete their labors.;;
Gen1SanityYes_Title;Vacation Offer Accepted;;
Gen1SanityYes_Content;Perhaps the weight of the work lay heavy upon their shoulders or the stress of parenthood prompted a needed escape. In either case, {0} would utilize this second home often. As they contemplated the calm ocean waters from their seaside villa, their child was left in the care of servants and spent their winters within the solitary stone walls of the cold estate.;;
Gen1SanityNo_Title;Time is Precious;;
Gen1SanityNo_Content;There was no time to rest. And even if there was, the frequent bouts of insomnia {0} experienced certainly eliminated the option. It was all in the work. They were convinced that this obsession that carved lines into their graying skin was more important than self-preservation. How could they vacation while perched on the precipice of a triumphant victory?;;
FeverServe1_Title;Fortuitous Assistance;;
FeverServe1_Content;The small village certainly offered a degree of seclusion and a minute amount of rustic charm on the days when gangrenous bodies of the afflicted were not carted through the streets. But in accordance with this anonymity, it did not easily provide the luxuries generally afforded to the whims of {0} young aristocrats and their spouses.<br /><br />The family was overjoyed then to receive a letter from some of their most trusted colleagues - however, this joy abated when they detailed an opportunity to offer wardship and tutelage to unfortunate youths failing in their studies. While the interruption was exasperating, an additional hand would allow them more time to focus on important work and to avoid the aromas of the local peasantry.<br />;
S5Special1_Title;The Town Is in Need of Direction;;
S5Special1_Content0;After the untimely death of the current mayor (and the previous three), the town was once again embroiled in politics. While several mediocre businessmen had thrown their hats into the arena, the family sensed a restlessness in the small village as they searched for direction forward. Having been raised with an affinity for friendly competition, it was decided that governance would be a droll leisure activity for the family. They decided to use their influence to sway the election in their favor.<br /><br />This was especially pressing as the new mayor would immediately ;;

S5Special1B_Title;Humble Beginnings;;
S5Special1B_Content0;The family had made their first mark on the history of the town, for good or ill. It would be several years before they would understand the ominous ramifications of this decision, but it was clear that life in {0} would never again be the same.;;
S5SpecialSetup1B_Title;Direction of the Town;;
FeverServe2_Title;Daughters Entrusted;;
FeverServe2_Content;During the heat of summer, a handsomely dressed woman arrived at each estate with a letter in hand. Interestingly, a former business associate of their mother's requested a daughter be put under each of the houses' charge - along with a considerable stipend to offset the cost. While an appreciable burden, it was irrefusable given the social mores of the time. Being twenty-three and therefore past the age of reasonable marriage, she accepted the new labors with a somewhat heavy heart and was quickly ingratiated into the fold.<br /> - along with a considerable stipend to offset the cost.

FeverHeart_0_Title;Legacy of Charity;;
FeverHeart2_0_Title;Charity Awarded;;
S5Fate1_Title;Financial Woes;;
S5Fate1_Content0;The village of {0} was, for lack of a more appropriate term, agricultural in its funds and like many similar small villages, were woefully unprepared for the ravages of disease. Despite the generosity (or lack thereof) of the family, the church's already severely limited resources have been stretched to their limit in their distinctly unscientific attempts to stem the spread of infection. With no more donations to call upon, the diocese turned to the local financial institutions for aide.;;
S5Fate1_Content1;With additional financial capital from the <b>Bank</b>, the church obtained the funds needed to build a Hospital. ;;
S5Fate1_Content2;The addition of a <b>Library</b> to the already strained finances of the village proved insurmountable, and the church failed to build a Hospital. Perhaps the lifestyle of an aristocrat blinded the mayor to this reality, but it was certain that the village would progress down a darker path.;;
S5Fate2_Title;FATE of the Infected;;
S5Fate2_Content0;The congregation and citizenry, stricken with the weight of those lost in the battle with Yellow Fever, could only provide a meager sum, which placed the financial future of the village into the hands of the most charitable scientists.;;
S5Fate2_Content1;<b>SUCCESS!</b><br />With charitable contributions totaling over <b>{0}</b> <icon=S1_HeartToken>, the Hospital was built. The additional medical infrastructure provided the town a respite from another severe outbreak and ushered in a new era.;;
S5Fate2_Content2;<b>FAILURE!</b><br />With charitable contributions failing to exceed <b>{0}</b> <icon=S1_HeartToken>, the Hospital was not built. This ill-timed news was delivered just as several new cases of influenza spread across the region. Without the Hospital, the results were drastic.;;
